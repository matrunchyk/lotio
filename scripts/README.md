# Scripts Directory

This directory contains build, test, and utility scripts for the `lotio` project.

## Core Build Scripts

### `install_skia.sh`

**Dependencies:** Requires `ninja`, `python3`, and system libraries (fontconfig, freetype, harfbuzz, icu4c, libpng, jpeg-turbo, libwebp)

**Used by:**
- `build_local.sh` (automatically calls if Skia not built)

- CI/CD workflows
- Docker builds

---

### `build_local.sh`
**Purpose:** Builds the native `lotio` binary for your platform

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/build_local.sh
```

**When to use:**

- Test scripts

---

### `build_skia_wasm.sh`

```

**When to use:**
- Before building WASM version of lotio
- First time setting up WASM build

**Dependencies:** Requires Emscripten (`emcc`)

**Output:** Skia libraries in `third_party/skia/skia/out/Wasm/`

**Used by:**
- `build_wasm.sh` (automatically calls if Skia WASM not built)

---

### `build_wasm.sh`
**Purpose:** Builds the WebAssembly version of lotio for browser use

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/build_wasm.sh
```

**When to use:**

**Used by:**
- CI/CD workflows (for npm package publishing)
- `test_wasm_local.sh`

---

## Dependency Management Scripts

### `sync_skia_deps.sh`
**Purpose:** Syncs Skia's third-party dependencies using `python3 tools/git-sync-deps`

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/sync_skia_deps.sh [skia_directory]
```

**When to use:**
- After cloning Skia repository
- When Skia dependencies are out of sync
- Before building Skia

**Used by:**
- CI/CD workflows
- `install_skia.sh` (indirectly)

---

### `fetch_skia_deps.sh`
**Purpose:** Fetches Skia's external dependencies (used in Docker builds)

```bash
./scripts/fetch_skia_deps.sh
```

**When to use:**
- Docker container builds
- Manual dependency fetching

**Used by:**
- Dockerfile

---

## Testing Scripts

### `test_local.sh`
**Purpose:** Quick local test script for macOS builds

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test_local.sh
```

**When to use:**
- Testing macOS build before pushing
- Verifying dependencies are installed
- Quick build validation

**What it does:**
- Checks dependencies
- Builds Skia if needed
- Builds lotio
- Tests binary

---

### `test_wasm_local.sh`
**Purpose:** Tests WASM build locally

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test_wasm_local.sh
```

**When to use:**
- Testing WASM build before pushing
- Verifying Emscripten setup
- Validating browser library build

**What it does:**
- Checks Emscripten installation
- Builds Skia for WASM if needed
- Builds lotio WASM
- Lists generated files

---

### `test_linux_build.sh`
**Purpose:** Tests Linux build in a Docker container

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test_linux_build.sh
```

**When to use:**
- Testing Linux compatibility
- Validating cross-platform builds
- Before releasing Linux packages

**What it does:**
- Runs Docker container
- Installs dependencies
- Builds Skia
- Builds lotio
- Tests binary

---

## Utility Scripts

### `check_build.sh`
**Purpose:** Monitors Skia build progress and status

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/check_build.sh
```

**When to use:**
- While Skia is building (takes 10-20 minutes)
- Checking if build is still running
- Monitoring build progress

**What it shows:**
- Build status (running/complete)
- Progress percentage
- Last build activity
- Library files status

**Tip:** Use `watch -n 2 './scripts/check_build.sh'` for real-time monitoring

---

### `debug_skia_gn.sh`
**Purpose:** Debug script to see GN configuration warnings

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/debug_skia_gn.sh
```

**When to use:**
- When Skia build fails with GN warnings
- Debugging build configuration issues
- Understanding GN build system

---

### `update_homebrew_formula.sh`
**Purpose:** Updates Homebrew formula after release

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/update_homebrew_formula.sh <version> <source_sha256> <bottle_sha256> <arch>
```

**When to use:**

## Typical Workflows

### First-time Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
brew install fontconfig freetype harfbuzz icu4c libpng jpeg-turbo libwebp ninja python@3.11

# 2. Build Skia (takes 10-20 minutes)
./scripts/install_skia.sh

# 3. Build lotio
./scripts/build_local.sh
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Make code changes, then:
./scripts/build_local.sh

# Or use Makefile:
make
```

### WASM Development
```bash
# 1. Install Emscripten
brew install emscripten

# 2. Build Skia for WASM
./scripts/build_skia_wasm.sh

# 3. Build lotio WASM
./scripts/build_wasm.sh
```

### Testing Before Push
```bash
# Test native build
./scripts/test_local.sh

# Test WASM build
./scripts/test_wasm_local.sh
```

## Notes

- All scripts use `set -e` to exit on errors
- Scripts automatically detect their location and set `PROJECT_ROOT`
- Most scripts provide helpful error messages and usage hints
- Scripts are designed to be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
